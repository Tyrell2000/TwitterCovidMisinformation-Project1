“Driven by the delta variant, cases are rising here at home particularly among those who are unvaccinated and appear likely to continue in the weeks ahead,” she said.

The White House has been pleading with eligible Americans who have not yet gotten vaccinated to do so immediately, citing the threat of the delta variant.

Studies have shown that the vaccines are effective against the delta variant.
