More than 600,000 people in the U.S. have now lost their lives to COVID-19, a staggering toll that comes even as new infections and deaths steadily decline and much of the country attempts to return to pre-pandemic normal life.
Worldwide, more than 176 million people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to , and more than 3.8 million have died from it.
The U.S. in late February became the first country to . That it has taken more than three months to reach 600,000 deaths is a testament to the slowing pandemic — it took just a month for the U.S. to jump from 300,000 to 400,000 COVID-19 deaths.
has set a goal of vaccinating 70 percent of U.S. adults with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by July 4. While 13 states have reached that threshold, others are lagging behind, especially in the southeast, and the nation appears increasingly unlikely to meet Biden's benchmark.
Officials have acknowledged that multiple states across the country have recently stopped asking for the full allotment of vaccines from the federal government. The federal government last week had to extend the shelf life of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by six weeks, after multiple state officials warned their doses in storage would expire before the end of this month.
Despite the drop in vaccine demand, the nationwide vaccination effort appears to be paying off, with the daily infection rate continuing to drop. In May, the number of new reported COVID-19 cases fell below 10,000 for the first time since March 2020.
More than 33 million coronavirus cases have been reported in the U.S. so far.
