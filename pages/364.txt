The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that vaccination is an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic and up until now the ACIP recommendations for phased allocation have provided guidance for federal, state, and local jurisdictions while vaccine supply was limited. However, given substantial increases in the supply of vaccines, it is appropriate to transition beyond priority groups and allow broad eligibility for receipt of COVID-19 vaccines consistent with applicable Emergency Use Authorizations. The following provides eligibility guidance for federal, state, and local jurisdictions as well as those enrolled in the federal pharmacy program.
The interim playbook serves as an interim playbook for state, territorial (including the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands [USAPI] of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau), tribal, and local public health programs and their partners on how to plan and operationalize a vaccination response to COVID-19 within their jurisdictions. The documentâ€™s sections cover specific areas of COVID-19 vaccination program planning and implementation and provide key guidance documents and links to resources to assist those efforts. Many, but not all, of the COVID-19 Vaccination Program activities described may overlap with routine activities; routine immunization and pandemic influenza program activities can serve as a foundation for COVID-19 vaccination planning.
