Across the nation, discussions about COVID-19 vaccines are unfolding everywhere, in doctors’ offices, at the barber shop, in churches and — of course — on social media. Although vaccination , misinformation (twisted facts) and disinformation (deliberate lies) have become almost ubiquitous in conversations about the vaccines, as millions of people are exposed to messages that are created to confuse and sow distrust. The tactics are working: say that they either believe, or aren’t sure whether to believe, some of these myths and lies.
It’s a devastating trend that causes real harm. People who disinformation about vaccines are to get vaccinated. So, although mis- and disinformation are not the only reason for low vaccine confidence, they clearly play a key role in the stalled U.S. vaccination rollout. And with an abundance of shots available but still only of the population fully vaccinated, the conditions were ripe for the delta variant to take hold.  We would not be seeing this in cases and hospitalizations were more people vaccinated. And were there less misinformation, more folks would have received their shots.
