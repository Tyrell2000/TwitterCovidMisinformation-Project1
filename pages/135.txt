At this time, there are limited data on vaccine protection in people who are immunocompromised. Further, data on which immunocompromising conditions might affect response to the COVID-19 vaccine and the magnitude of risk are not available. Examples of such immunocompromising conditions likely include, but might not be limited to, receiving chemotherapy for cancer, hematologic malignancies, being within one year from receiving a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant, untreated HIV infection with CD4 T lymphocyte count < 200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder, and taking immunosuppressive medications (e.g., drugs to suppress rejection of transplanted organs or to treat rheumatologic conditions such as mycophenolate and rituximab, receipt of prednisone >20mg/day for more than 14 days.)
The following recommendations are based on what is known about currently available COVID-19 vaccines. These recommendations will be updated as additional information, including regarding the ability of currently authorized vaccines to protect against infection with novel variants and the effectiveness of additional authorized vaccines, becomes available. This could result in additional circumstances when work restrictions for fully vaccinated HCP are recommended.
