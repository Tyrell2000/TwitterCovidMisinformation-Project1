Nursing home residents are at high risk for infection, serious illness, and death from COVID-19. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in respiratory specimens detects current infections (referred to here as ) among residents in nursing homes. Viral testing of residents in nursing homes, with authorized nucleic acid amplification tests or antigen detection assays, is an important addition to other (IPC) recommendations aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering nursing homes, detecting cases quickly, and stopping transmission.Â  This guideline is based on currently available information about COVID-19 and will be refined and updated as more information becomes available.
While this guidance focuses on testing in nursing homes, several of the recommendations such as testing residents with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and testing asymptomatic close contacts should also be applied to other long-term care facilities (e.g., assisted living facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities, institutions for mental disease, and psychiatric residential treatment facilities).
