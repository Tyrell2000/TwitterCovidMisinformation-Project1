Most routine medical procedures or screenings can be performed before or after getting a COVID-19 vaccine. These can include:
If you are due for a mammogram and have been recently vaccinated for COVID-19, ask your doctor how long you should wait after vaccination to get your mammogram. People who have received a COVID-19 vaccine can have swelling in the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) in the underarm near where they got the shot. This swelling is a normal sign that your body is building protection against COVID-19. However, it is possible that this swelling could cause a false reading on a mammogram. Some experts recommend getting your mammogram before being vaccinated or waiting four to six weeks after getting your vaccine.
If you have recently had surgery, been hospitalized, or had a procedure that required anesthesia, or if you have any of these events coming up, talk to your doctor about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Your doctor will help you decide when to be vaccinated to make sure the benefits of vaccination outweigh potential risks.
