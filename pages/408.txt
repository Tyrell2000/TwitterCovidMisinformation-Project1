CDC is conducting several large-scale geographic seroprevalence studies to learn more about the percentage of people in the United States who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This involves working with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to better understand COVID-19 in the United States using serology testing ( ) for surveillance (“seroprevalence surveys” or “serosurveys”). CDC also wants to better understand how the virus is spreading through the US population over time. Because infected people can have mild illness or no symptoms (and therefore might not get medical care or testing), CDC is collaborating with and centers on a variety of large-scale geographic seroprevalence surveys across the United States.
