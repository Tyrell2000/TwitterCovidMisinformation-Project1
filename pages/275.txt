Strong confidence in COVID-19 vaccines within communities leads to more people getting vaccinated, which leads to fewer COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. This toolkit is designed to help educational leaders and partners reinforce confidence in this important prevention tool among teachers, childcare workers, teaching assistants, paraprofessional educators, office staff, bus drivers, school nurses and counselors, school nutrition staff, coaches and athletic trainers, custodians, and security staff.
