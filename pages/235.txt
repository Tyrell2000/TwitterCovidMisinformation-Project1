In a thread of tweets, Corbett described her time watching people come and go in a Louisiana ICU as she experienced a "non-COVID family emergency."

4/n: I am a COVID vaccine inventor. … In Louisiana… a “hot-spot”… watching the virus do what viruses do. … Feeling helpless because people are opting out of the vaccine. I um… I… I don’t have the words.
Corbett said that during her time in Louisiana she encountered a grieving wife, a woman who wept openly in the ICU and a staff member who informed her that a two-person visitation limit would soon be ending as a result of the surge of COVID-19 in the state.
Corbett is the lead scientist for the National Institutes of Health’s coronavirus vaccine research and helped invent Moderna's vaccine.
6/n: Update: My ICU waiting room friend lost her husband to COVID. Yesterday, I grieved her husband like I would grieve an uncle. I can only imagine what the ICU docs and nurses have been through for 1.5 years.
