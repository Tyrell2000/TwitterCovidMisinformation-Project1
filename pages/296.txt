You may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still be infected and spread the virus to others. You and your travel companions (including ) pose a risk to your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you travel.
If you have a medical appointment that cannot be postponed, call your doctor’s office and tell them you have or may have COVID-19. This will help people in the office protect themselves and other patients. See CDC’s page on for more details.
