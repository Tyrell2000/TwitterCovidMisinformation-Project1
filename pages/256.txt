Given that India is routinely reporting over 200,000 new COVID-19 cases per day (which is likely to be a vast underestimate) and given the fact that several dangerous variants have emerged in India, I believe it is prudent for us to institute a temporary full travel ban to all travelers coming here from India. At the same time, travel to India should be stopped to all but the most essential (and vaccinated) personnel. All routine flights to and from the U.S. should be immediately cancelled.
Consider that just last week a flight from New Delhi to Hong Kong ended with a third of all travelers contracting COVID-19. Like Israel, or the United Kingdom, today’s success stories will be most useful to the rest of the world if we can control our own COVID-19 numbers here at home, rather than importing thousands more cases. We need to take a lead from Australia, which has all flights from India until at least mid-May. We need to do the same here.
Misra identified the larger problem as vaccine non-compliance rather than lack of vaccine availability. He told me that “quacks” are fanning the flames of COVID-19 in the rural areas of India by creating false fear of the vaccine. Meanwhile, hospitals in India are overloaded and there is a shortage of oxygen and other primary supplies.
Throughout the pandemic, even as India was trying (and, for the most part, succeeding) to control its own COVID-19 outbreaks, skirmishes between China and India occurred along the Sino-Indian border. So it is somewhat ironic that now China is offering its assistance and blaming the U.S. for being slow to provide the raw materials. At the same time, China’s own vaccine, Sinovac, has come under worldwide for underperforming.
