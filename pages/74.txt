Since I last addressed you fourteen days ago, we have been fighting a battle on two fronts – the first against the deadly coronavirus, the second against the actions of those who have sought to create instability and chaos.
Firstly, we have to contain the spread of the coronavirus and limit its impact on economic activity.
The coronavirus pandemic is the greatest threat to the lives and health of our people and to the recovery and transformation of our economy.
Based on the recommendations of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19, and inputs from the President’s Coordinating Council, Cabinet this afternoon decided that the country should be moved from Adjusted Alert Level 4 and be placed on Adjusted Alert Level 3.  This will take effect later this evening once the regulations have been gazetted.
As we have always said, our most effective weapon in the fight against COVID-19 is an effective and comprehensive vaccination programme.
Within the next two to three months, we are scheduled to receive around 31 million additional doses from Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.
A few days ago, the Biovac Institute in Cape Town was appointed to manufacture the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for distribution within Africa.
This evening we are announcing a range of measures to support the recovery of the economy and provide relief to the poor and those who are vulnerable as a result of the measures that we had to impose to deal with COVID-19.
Two weeks ago, we announced that the COVID-19 TERS scheme would be extended for those sectors which were affected by Alert Level 4 restrictions during the past 28 days.
