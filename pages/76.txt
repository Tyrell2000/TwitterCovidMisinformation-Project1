It is my pleasure to announce the formal commencement of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in the post-schooling education and training sector (PSET).
I say formal because in several respects, our sector has already undertaken important work to support the national vaccination drive and protect individuals within our sector who are at highest risk of COVID-19.
As the scientists continues to track the epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus, its waves and mutations, we are also getting to better understand peopleâ€™s knowledge, attitudes and perceptions about the COVID vaccination.
Coming to the main reason of our briefing today, let me indicate that our vaccination programme extends and deepens our comprehensive sectoral contribution to the national COVID response which has been developed and supported by HIGHER HEALTH since the beginning of the pandemic in South Africa.
Let me upfront indicate that within the PSET sector, we will be rolling out the Pfizer vaccines across all our institutions in the major metros where we have good access to cold storage facilities.
We will be rolling out J&J vaccines across our rural districts as this requires cold storage facilities at higher temperatures than Pfizer and other mRNA vaccines.
I would like to remind all of us that the key principles of beating COVID have not changed: social distancing; minimising personal contact; wearing a mask; sanitising and now vaccinating.
