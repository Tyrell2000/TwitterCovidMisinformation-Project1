Pregnant and recently pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 â€”including illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breath, or illness that results in death compared with non-pregnant people. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 are at increased risk of preterm birth and might be at increased risk for other adverse outcomes. If you are pregnant, you can receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
