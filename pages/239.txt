Miami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said Saturday that at least six firefighters who had been assisting in search and rescue efforts at the site of the Surfside, Fla., condo building collapse have tested positive for COVID-19.
Cominsky said that the specific task force has since left the area and that following the positive tests, COVID-19 testing was conducted on “all 424 Florida task force members in addition to the ones that were from the task force that left.”
