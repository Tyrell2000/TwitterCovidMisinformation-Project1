efforts provide support to people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (cases) and exposed to (contacts) to facilitate prompt isolation and quarantine in order to prevent further spread of SARS-CoV-2. The is defined according to the infectious period. The in preventing the further spread of COVID-19 occurs when contacts begin quarantine within 6 days of exposure to a person with COVID-19, regardless of the presence of symptoms.
is another valuable approach to contact tracing. It involves looking back over the  to symptom onset or specimen collection date (for asymptomatic cases) and identifying interactions with people ( ), that may have been the source of the infection for the person with COVID-19 (see Figure 1). To identify person(s), places(s), or event(s) most likely to be the source of exposure to the index case, the timeframe of 2–7 days prior to symptom onset or specimen collection date can be considered.  Source investigation follows the path from one case to another, providing opportunities to identify additional (secondary) cases who may be undiagnosed. In this context, a secondary case is another case potentially infected by or linked to the potential source case. (See Figure 2). It also facilitates opportunities for testing, isolation, and quarantine for their contacts. Source investigation is often referred to as “backward, “retrospective,” “bidirectional,” or “reverse” contact tracing.
