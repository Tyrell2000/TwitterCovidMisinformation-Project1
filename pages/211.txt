Applications for the special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant are only electronic. If you need assistance to apply, SASSA staff and appointed volunteers can assist.
The Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress amount is R350 per month, from the date it is approved. Applicants will be paid from the month in which they apply – there will be no backpay.
