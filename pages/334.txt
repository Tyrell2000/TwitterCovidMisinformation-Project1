Vaccinate with Confidence Strategy to Reinforce Confidence in COVID-19
Most people in the United States are planning to get vaccinated against COVID-19, but some may want more information before seeking vaccination. They may want to know more about COVID-19 vaccines, including the process for developing and authorizing these vaccines and information about their safety and effectiveness. People may also have previous experiences that affect their trust and confidence in the health system, which could affect their decision to get vaccinated.
CDC regularly creates reports about the status of COVID-19 vaccine confidence in the United States, emphasizing major themes that influence vaccine confidence and uptake. The reports include analyses of multiple quantitative and qualitative data sources, ranging from social listening and web metrics to immunization survey data and CDC-INFO inquiries. The reports seek to identify emerging issues of misinformation, disinformation, and places where intervention efforts can positively increase vaccine confidence across the United States.
