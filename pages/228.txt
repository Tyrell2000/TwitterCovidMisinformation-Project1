Pfizer and BioTech said on Thursday they were from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The companies said in their statement that an ongoing trial of the booster shot was showing "encouraging data."  The companies said that when the dose is administered six months after the second dose, it provided levels of neutralizing antibodies five to 10 times higher.
“What the CDC and the FDA were saying, Jake, is that right now, given the data and the information we have, we do not need to give people a third shot, a boost superimposed upon the two doses you get with the mRNA and the one dose you get with [Johnson & Johnson],” Fauci told CNN host during “State of the Union.”
