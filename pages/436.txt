CDC and other partners assess how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions. Assessing how vaccines work in the real-world is important to:

CDC is assessing how well COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions. Some real-world assessments observe both people who get vaccinated and those who donâ€™t to see how many people in each group become ill with COVID-19. Some assessments look at how COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness differs for people who are partially vaccinated compared to those who are fully vaccinated.
Understanding how COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions will allow CDC, FDA, and other partners to ensure vaccines offer real-world protection against COVID-19.
