An increase in COVID-19 cases also creates more opportunities for the virus to mutate, which could lead to the emergence of new . Variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are now responsible for all cases in the United States. The original strain is no longer detected among variants circulating throughout the country. The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant is now the predominant variant in the United States, making up an estimated of recent U.S. cases. The best way to slow the emergence of new variants is to reduce the spread of infection by taking measures to protect yourself, including getting a vaccine when it’s available to you.

To date, four variants have been classified as a (VOC). * of SARS-CoV-2 cases caused by these VOCs for the two weeks ending July 17 are summarized here. Nationally, the proportion of cases attributed to B.1.617.2 (Delta) is predicted to increase to 83.2%; B.1.1.7 (Alpha) proportion is predicted to decrease to 8.3%; P.1 (Gamma) proportion is predicted to decrease to 3.3%; and B.1.351 (Beta) is predicted to decrease to below 0.1%. Nowcast estimates predict that B.1.617.2 (Delta) will continue to be the predominant lineage circulating in all HHS regions and be more than 75% in eight HHS regions. B.1.1.7 (Alpha) is predicted to be less than 20% in all HHS regions. P.1 (Gamma) is predicted to be less than 7% in all HHS regions; and B.1.351 (Beta) is predicted to be less than or equal to 0.1% in all HHS regions.

Just over two-thirds (68.6%) of people ages 18 or older have received at least one dose of vaccine and 59.7% are fully vaccinated. For people ages 12 or older, 65.9% have received at least one dose of vaccine and 57.1% are fully vaccinated.
CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) shows that since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, people ages 65 years and older were the age group with the highest rates of hospitalization among all adults. While hospitalization rates in this age group had been decreasing over several months, preliminary data from the past 3 weeks show that rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations are again rising in adults ages 65 years and older. These are the first increases in rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations seen in this age group since April 2021.
The current 7-day moving average of new deaths (223) has increased 9.3% compared with the previous 7-day moving average (204). As of July 21, a total of 607,684 COVID-19 deaths have been reported.
