The COVID-19 infection cases continue to fluctuate in waves and each wave leaves behind bereaved families and lost loved ones. Each day that this pandemic continues to spread and infect more people, it robs our country its greatest resource and that is its productive people.
These social unrests have added to the complexity of our fight againstÂ  the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the violent nature of the protests unsettled the health care as a whole in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.
I cannot thank healthcare workers, doctors, Nurses and all other supporting staff in health care centres enough for continuing to be in the forefront of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, even in circumstances where your lives were in danger.
